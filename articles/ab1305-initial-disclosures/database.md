# AB1305 Database

Californiaâ€™s AB1305 offset disclosure law will go into full effect in January 2025, but a handful of companies have already posted AB1305-compliant disclosures online. We tracked down 25 of these early disclosures and transcribed their data, which you can [download](https://carbonplan-ab1305-initial-disclosures.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ab1305-raw-data.csv) or explore below. Where possible, we provide links to additional offset project information either on [OffsetsDB](https://carbonplan.org/research/offsets-db) (colored project badges) or alternative websites.
