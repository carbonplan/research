        This calculator computes the cost per net ton of COâ‚‚ captured by a
        hypothetical DAC facility coupled to different energy sources. The model
        estimates the levelized cost of energy, capital expenses, and operation
        and maintenance costs. The entire model is implemented natively in
        Javascript, and a Python version is under development. The model is
